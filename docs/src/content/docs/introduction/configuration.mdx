title: Configuration
---

Configuration is a key part of plugins; they allow the user to customize messages, behaviour, or
even make their own mechanics. Of course, since configuration is such a vital part of plugin
development, like everything else, Bedrock provides first-class support for it.

> Configuration should always be stateless; there are no exceptions.

Since configuration is stateless, there must be a no-args constructor in the class annotated with `@Configuration`.
Let's create a simple `Config` class:

```java
@Configuration("cool")
public class Config {
    @ConfigurationValue("join")
    public String join = "<player> has joined!";
}
```

Now let's use it:

```java
final Config config = ConfigLoader.load(Config.class, FileExtension.YML);

EventNode.global().addListener(PlayerJoinEvent.class, event -> {
    final Player player = event.getPlayer();
    event.joinMessage(MiniMessage.miniMessage().deserialize(config.join, TagResolver.resolver("player",
        Tag.selfClosingInserting(player.displayName()))));
    });
```

Just like that, we have created a simple config for our plugin.

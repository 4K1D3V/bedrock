title: GUI
---

A GUI (pronounced _gooey_) is one of the most important parts of the user experience
for people using your plugin. Whether it be server administrators or players,
GUI's are much more user friendly than commands.

Since GUI's are so vital, **Bedrock** provides first-class support for all types of GUI's.
Let's make a GUI together:

```java
Menu menu = Menu.Inventory
                .two()
                .name(Component.empty())
                .button(Button.builder()
                        .item(ItemStack.of(Material.LIME_WOOL))
                        .slot(3)
                        .leftClicked(ctx -> {
                            ctx.player().sendMessage("left click");
                        }))
                .build();

```

> A Menu is a wrapper over traditional GUI's that is the foundation of Bedrock's approach to user interfaces.

In the above code, we created a relatively simple menu, though it can be a little hard to read at first glance;
let's break it down step by step:

- `Menu.Inventory.two()` creates a generic **menu _builder_** that is 2 rows long.
- `.name(Component.empty())` is the name of the menu. Menus must always have a name, and the
  builder takes in a `Component`, which in this case, is empty.
- `.button()` lets us add a button to the menu, either with a `Button` or a `ButtonBuilder`. The
  button builder is self-explanatory, and should not need clarification.<br/>
- `.build()` builds the `MenuBuilder` into a `Menu`, which can be shown to players using the
  `show(Player)` method.

Let's show this menu to a player:

```java
Player player = // some reference to a player....
menu.show(player);
```

Great. Now, time to go through some necessary definitions:

> **Context**: An object that is created when an action occurs in a menu.

Throughout these docs, there will not be much explanation, and moreso just covering of the features
provided by the **framework**. The code is well-documented and is usually self-explanatory. With
that being said, let's create our first plugin with **Bedrock**:

```java
@Plugin("example")
public class ExamplePlugin extends JavaPlugin {}
```

Just like that, you've created your first plugin. No manual yml registration, and no need to leave your source file.

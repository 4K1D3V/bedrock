title: Ticks
---

Ticks is a standard utility class that turns magic numbers like `20L * 3` into `Ticks.seconds(3)`.
Showcasing different units of time:

```java
Duration duration = ...
Ticks.duration(duration);
Ticks.seconds(1);
Ticks.minutes(1);
Ticks.hours(1);
Ticks.days(1);
Ticks.seconds(1.5);
```

There are also methods that take in fractional values (like decimals) and convert them to ticks,
as seen above.

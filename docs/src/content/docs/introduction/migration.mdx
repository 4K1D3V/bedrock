title: Migration
---

We're glad that you're deciding to migrate from Paper to **Bedrock**. The migration should be
relatively simple. With that being said, let's do this!

This is the order in which you will be migrating features:

- Plugin Declaration
- Listeners
- Commands
- GUI's
- Tasks

Let's do the first step in the migration process: using the `@Plugin` annotation.<br/>
Say we have a `paper-plugin.yml` like this:

```yml
name: MigrationPlugin
version: "1.0"
main: foo.bar.baz.MigrationPlugin
description: A dummy plugin that does not actually exist.
api-version: "1.21.10"
bootstrapper: foo.bar.baz.MigrationPluginBootstrap
loader: foo.bar.baz.MigrationPluginLoader
```

On your class that extends `JavaPlugin`, in this case, `MigrationPlugin`, annotate it with `@Plugin`:

```java
@Plugin(
        value = "migration",
        description = "A dummy plugin that does not actually exist.",
        apiVersion = "1.21.10",
        version = "1.0",
        bootstrapper = MigrationPluginBootstrap.class,
        loader = MigrationPluginLoader.class
)
public class MigrationPlugin extends JavaPlugin {

}
```

Now, you can delete your `paper-plugin.yml` from your `src/main/resources` directory.

Second, if you have any classes that implement Bukkit's listener (`org.bukkit.event.Listener`), those should
be migrated first.

Say we have a listener like this:

```java
public class Listeners implements Listener {
    @EventHandler
    public void onPlayerJoin(PlayerJoinEvent event) {
        // ...
    }

    @EventHandler
    public void onPlayerQuit(PlayerQuitEvent event) {
        // ...
    }

    @EventHandler
    public void onBlockBreak(BlockBreakEvent event) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

And we register it like this:

```java
@Plugin(
        value = "migration",
        description = "A dummy plugin that does not actually exist.",
        apiVersion = "1.21.10",
        version = "1.0",
        bootstrapper = MigrationPluginBootstrap.class,
        loader = MigrationPluginLoader.class
)
public class MigrationPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        getServer().getPluginManager().registerEvents(new Listeners());
    }
}
```

Events are one of the most important parts of a plugin. Of course, that means they
get first class treatment within the framework. First, let's cover some definitions:

> Listener: Something that can act upon an event.

> Event Node: An object that can have an arbitary amount of listeners and children event nodes.

> Global Event Node: The root event node to which all events are propagated and all children are directly/indirectly attached to.

```java
EventNode.global().addListener(PlayerJoinEvent.class, event -> {
    final Player player = event.getPlayer();

    player.sendMessage(Component.text("You joined the game!"));
});
```

An event can be manually fired to the global event node by doing:

```java
Events.fire(new MyCustomEvent());
```

All listeners on the global event node and its children will have this event be propagated to them,
and will be able to do something with them.

There is also a builder for events that can be used:

```java
node.addListener(EventListener.builder(PlayerJoinEvent.class, event -> {
    event.getPlayer().sendMessage(Component.text("Your health is less than or equal to 15!"));
}).predicate(event -> event.getPlayer().getHealth() <= 15));
```

As you can see, this system is far more powerful than Bukkit's standard event listener system.

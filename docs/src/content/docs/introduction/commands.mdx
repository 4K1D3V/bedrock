title: Commands
---

In **Bedrock**, commands are not implemented in the framework itself. Instead, the framework
includes a transitive dependency: [Funmands](https://github.com/SlimifiedxD/funmands). Funmands is a declarative command framework
for Minecraft, and is built by the same team behind Bedrock. The reason it is not included in
Bedrock itself is because Bedrock is built for **Paper**, whilst Funmands is designed to be platform-agonstic and run
on any environment that has brigadier, including **Paper**, **Velocity**, **Fabric**, and **Forge**.
With that being said, let's make a command using **Funmands**:

```java
public class ExampleCommand extends PaperCommand {
    public ExampleCommand() {
        super("example", "An example command.", "e", "ex");

        this.addFormat("", ctx -> {
            ctx.getExecutor().sendMessage("this is executed when a sender does /example, /e, or /ex!");
        });

        this.addFormat("target:player", ctx -> {
            final Player target = ctx.get("player");
            ctx.getExecutor().sendMessage(target.displayName());
        });
    }
}
```

Now, let's register it:

```java
PaperFunmandsManager commandManager = new PaperFunmandsManager(this.getLifecycleManager());

commandManager.registerCommand(new ExampleCommand());
```
